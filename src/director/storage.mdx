## Dummy

Is the default driver and it does nothing - snapshots won't be saved.

Set the environment variable to define the screenshots driver.

```
SCREENSHOTS_DRIVER="../screenshots/dummy.driver"
```

## AWS S3

The driver generates upload URLs for S3 bucket. When set up properly the following will happen when each test suite finishes:

- cypress agent reports to `director` what videos and / or failed tests screenshots are availabe.
- `director` uses AWS credentials to generate
  - a temporary signed URL for each screenshot / video
  - a read URL is saved to associated test results
- cypress agent uses the temporary URL to upload the assets
- dashboard uses the read URL to display video / screenshots

### Setup

Please make sure that [AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) with proper access to invoke [`s3.getSignedUrl`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#getSignedUrl-property) are available in the environment.

### Configuration

You can customize certain aspects of how `director` handles upload and read URLs generation by setting up environment variables.

#### `SCREENSHOTS_DRIVER`

Defines what screenshot driver to use. In order to use S3 driver set value:

```sh
SCREENSHOTS_DRIVER="../screenshots/s3.driver"
```

#### `S3_BUCKET`

Set the bucket name to store the asset. There's no default value, you have to set it before using the driver.

```sh
S3_BUCKET="your_bucket_name"
```

#### `S3_REGION`

AWS region, default value is `"us-east-1"`

```sh
S3_REGION="us-east-1"
```

#### `S3_ACL`

ACL settings that for new S3 items. The default value is `"public-read"`. Read more about [S3 ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).

```sh
S3_ACL="public-read"
```

#### `S3_READ_URL_PREFIX`

The URL prefix to use when reading the screenshots / video. The default value is `https://${S3_BUCKET}.s3.amazonaws.com/${key}`.

Setting `S3_READ_URL_PREFIX` to `http://example.com` will change the generated URL to `https://example.com/${key}`.

```sh
S3_READ_URL_PREFIX=<null>
```

## Minio Driver

[MinIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinIO) can help you to setup local Amazon S3 compatible storage stack.

- You should be able to change the environment variables according to your Minio setup. Please refer to the default values at [`src/screenshots/minio/config.ts`](https://github.com/agoldis/sorry-cypress/blob/master/packages/director/src/screenshots/minio/config.ts).

- The available minio configuration resembles S3 storage driver configruation.

- Treat your Minio keys and secrets AWS credentials and hide them.

- Behing the scenes, `director` generates a [pre-signed upload URL](https://docs.min.io/docs/upload-files-from-browser-using-pre-signed-urls.html), that cypress agents use to upload screenshots and videos.

* **Warning!** The example `docker-compose.minio.yml` deletes existing buckets, so please test - or remove from the docker file after first run!

### Configuration

See [`docker-compose.minio.yml`](https://github.com/agoldis/sorry-cypress/blob/master/docker-compose.minio.yml) for ready-to-use sorry-cypress configuration that uses locally hosted Minio as a storage layer.

#### `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`

For accessing minio, `docker-compose.minio.yml` generates a predefined set of credentials, e.g.:

```sh
/usr/bin/mc config host add myminio http://storage:9000 MW32h3gd6HvjBEgTRx t6NgQWUcEyG2AzaDCVkN6sbWcvDCVkN6sGiZ7;
```

#### `MINIO_ENDPOINT`

Hostname or IP address that **both `director` and cypress agents** will use to communicate with `minio` service.

- Please make sure that your network configuration allows access to `minio` resouce for cypress agents and for `director` service

- To run on the local machine, edit your `/etc/hosts` file to allow cypress agents discover the local instance of minio

```sh
127.0.0.1 storage
```

#### `MINIO_PORT`

Port that `director` and cypress agents will use to communicate with `minio`.

#### `MINIO_BUCKET`

Bucket name for storing generated artifacts. Please make sure that the bucket is created and configured properly before using it.

#### `MINIO_USESSL`

Whether `director` should use SSL for communicating with `minio`.

#### `MINIO_URL`

The public URL used for public read access to the stored screenshots and videos.
This URL should be available from your browser and it will be used to fetch generated screenshots and videos.

#### `MINIO_READ_URL_PREFIX`

You can override the whole read URL, including the bucket name using this variable. Most chances you won't need it, if you do, see the [source code](https://github.com/sorry-cypress/sorry-cypress/blob/master/packages/director/src/screenshots/minio/minio.ts#L42)
